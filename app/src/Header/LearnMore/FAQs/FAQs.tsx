          My hopes and dreams with the product include the ability to
          redistribute subscriptions. I think this has the potential to change
          the digital learning landscape. My work is informed by these three
          founding principles:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>Every student should have access to many good teachers.</li>
            <li>Online education should be the best education.</li>
            <li>Learning creates scholarships.</li>
          </ol>
          Robots Building Education uses a system called Proof Of Work to
          measure learning. When you use the application, you're putting robots
          to work! That work produces outcomes that should be meaningful to
          neighborhoods, like improved finance for under-resourced schools or
          homes. You can think of this as a decentralized fabric that allows
          education technology to become a public service.
          <br />
          <br />
          The vision is to turn this into a decentralized protocol. Systems and
          interfaces should allow us to rewire education services, finance and
          content for a new era of software.

            If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know
            it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the
            supply and demand of things in a relevant way.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more
            people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable
            amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer
            would create more work than they could complete.
            <br />
            <br />
            So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than
            without it and I believe that it makes more things like
            entrepreneurship more accessible.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good
            decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted.
            In my view, that's more senior and executive roles, and thus you
            could start to build businesses more reasonably as a result. So
            that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope
            that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.

            When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is
            not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile
            device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.
            <br /> <br />
            If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I
            recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can
            afford.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reason why is because you just want to solve that problem and
            macbook pros are good general solutions to what you'll need in a
            number of careers. If you need something specialized for gaming or
            some AI and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar
            spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.
            <br />
            <br />
            But what if you're in a budget? In that case, any laptop will do for
            what's being taught here. You can even get away with doing something
            on an ipad these days, with how some web services like Github
            Codespaces or Codepen has improved over the years.

            This is a loaded question and we work on it before looking at code.
            <br />
            <br />
            To answer your question, no. You don't have to be good at math. And
            programming isn't hard, it's challenging. It's about organizing
            information. Now to address you question - you learn a lot more than
            just coding here and you should know that you can accomplish the
            things you want to accomplish. There are many days where I wish I
            was a better drawer and I'm sure if you looked at me you'd feel
            confident I could achieve that. I feel that way about math to you.
            Maybe no one made you understand why it's important - for me it gave
            me access to freedom and what I feel is the deepest understanding
            the universe has to offer. And with that I could do anything. So I
            was willing to fail for that.
            <br />
            <br />
            So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that
            wishes someone would tell you that it's easy. People can make it
            easier. It's going to be a challenge, intellectual or emotional, but
            that's part of the fun too. I'm here to tell you that I want you to
            learn more than just coding, coding is just a medium for that
            feeling I want you to experience from learning.

            So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across
            Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before
            explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of
            machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to
            solve. You can answer that deeply or as strategically as you want,
            but either way answering those questions will get you the best
            answer to this question.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the
            internet. They're mostly used to answer to do a lot of the service
            work of the internet, like how we could our web browsers or how we
            code the cloud.
            <br />
            <br />
            But what if you need and iOS app, an android one, a video game, or
            some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you "learn one
            language, you kinda learn them all". Again, there's a reason for
            that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how
            to use a hammer or drill when building a home, you're likely going
            to use both eventually and it'll feel pretty familiar.

      question: "Is bootcamp worth it?",

          {/* <h3 style={{ maxWidth: "100%", width: 700 }}>
            Is bootcamp worth it?
          </h3> */}
          <p style={{ maxWidth: "100%", width: 700 }}>
            As usual, the best answer is going to be "it depends". I recommend
            bootcamps if the value of your time is extremely high. For example,
            you need to take care of a newborn child and want to create more
            time and opportunity. Another example is that you have a healthy
            bank account and you have thoroughly examined your intent for paying
            a premium for time.
            <br />
            <br />I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shorcut into the
            industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going
            to college. You will still need to
            <ul>
              <li>Find some kind of education</li>
              <li>Find some kind of early employment</li>
              <li>Build business-savvy projects</li>
              <li>Pass technical interviews</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught
            developer in San Francisco is different than a self-taught developer
            in Nebraska. A computer science student at Stanford will have a
            different environment than someone at a community college. The key
            thing here is that your envionrment plays an important role in your
            opportunities - so control for it early and often! That's why you're
            here! I want you to be successful before you start your journey.

            In general, you want to prepare for the most competitive option
            available to you. When it comes to questions like these, I recommend
            to critically examine reputation and accreditation.

            <br />I think WGU is interesting because it has an intentional
            approach to what it's trying to do with education. It's an access
            platform. Regardless, I advise you to prepare for the material
            before class. In fact, that is one of the strongest predictors for a
            student's success in a classroom - exposure to material before
            teaching.

            Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere.
            Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to
            organize information. Software engineers study computer science.
            Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is
            problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving
            problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media,
            medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems
            or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred
            game for entrepeneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced
            life approach with it too. So sometimes people code becasue they
            want a more relaxed life too.

            No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience
            some "rustyness" if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in
            some time, but that's not too different than a college student
            realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already
            know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly
            you have an advantage. This is a reason I suggest people spend time
            reflecting often, you'd be surprised how much empowerment you can
            draw from it.
            <br />
            <br />
            On that note, I would even consider seeing age as an advantage
            rather than a disadvantage. As the technology industry matures,
            experience and execution will be valued more than innovation, speed
            and the tradeoffs that happen with it. As one of my directors say,
            slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This isn't to create any sense of
            superiority or inferiority - you're just in a competitive market and
            it's usually better to take the productive outlook.

            These are subjects I'm not familiar with so I'm hesistant on
            providing guidance at risk of misinforming someone. Reddit tends to
            be a good place to gather consensus but be careful not to accept a

            Yes. School was complicated for me. I dropped out twice but not
            finishing was not an option. While I was in school, I studied what
            early bootcamps were teaching. It was a different time and it helped
            me be less bored at school. I started working on RO.B.E in college
            to make my education more interesting.
