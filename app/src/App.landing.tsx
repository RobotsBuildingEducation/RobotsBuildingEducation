                Believe it. You're not in the position to judge me when you
                trust Tiktok to recommend you content. Did you know Musical.ly
                was an education app first? They gave up. Sold out. Yeah. So now
                we're here fixing the mess they created.

                <br />
                Anyway. You gotta get on our level! I'm pretty good and I keep
                getting better. I mean check this advanced code out. That's me.

                before! Easy for ME! üòé

                Okay okay I'll stop messing around. We're building this platform
                because we believe that we can create scholarships with
                learning. This means that we manually create these scholarships
                if you subscribe to Patreon, which is made publicly free too.
                Feel welcome to use the tools at the bottom as they continue to
                advance with you over time:
                <br />
                <br />
                Programmatically, this means we research ways to make Bitcoin
                more accessible and meaningful. Bitcoin allows us to monetize
                user experiences instead of offering subscription services. It's
                here where we believe that this decentralized network can change
                finance for education services.
                <br />
                <br />
                And you ought to believe it because you did create your account
                already using a decentralized identity! You did that inside of
                Tiktok! So in a way it's like Tiktok's AI is helping us create
                scholarships too.
                <br />
                <br />
                So that's why it's called Robots Building Education. We designed
                this platform to create scholarships out of learning.
